# Labora
Labora works with creative practitiones to identify and overcome the limitations of job hyperflexibility in creative and tech industries. The goal is to collectively find solutions to problems generated by overexposed to market dynamics, such as lack of social security, 
lack of proper office space, isolation, etc. The project is currently in its theoretical phase. 
If you are a creative practitioner, a freealncer, a startupper, a remote worker, a solopreneur, a contract worker or you are interested in the project, you are more than welcome to parrticipate!

## The Problem

## The Solution
Explain what makes your project special, useful, exciting! You can use the ideas you generated for “Unique Value Proposition” in your Open Canvas here.

## Get involved!

Show how to get started using or contributing to the project. If you’re just getting started, this could be as simple as asking people to attend a planning call or kick-off event, or sign up for an email newsletter about the project. If you’re not sure quite how to get users involved just yet, don’t worry! In the next module, you’ll devise some ways for newcomers to get involved, and create contributor guidelines. Once you’ve done the next module, and you can come back to this README and add a link to contributor guidelines to this section.
State what resources are most needed. If you have a need for a special kind of help, expertise, or a resource like event space, be sure to mention that here.
